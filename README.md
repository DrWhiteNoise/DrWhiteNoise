## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is "semi-anonymous" space with some personal [reflections](https://whitenoise.dev/articles) and [projects](https://whitenoise.dev/projects). 

I am broadly interested in Machine learning & AI, with a particular focus on building systems that make the *right* decisions. 

Feel thankful? 
- Support my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/DrWhiteNoise) or with [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/drwhitenoise).

Feel intrigued? 
- Shoot me an email at `dr <AT> whitenoise <DOT> dev`.   
- PGP key: [386360B0504DA86B](https://whitenoise.dev/drwn.asc).
